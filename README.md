# Train Schedular

## Description

This is the seventh assignment for the UNCC Coding Bootcamp in NC.

In this assignment, we were required to create a webpage that uses the Google Firebase database to store information, then display that information above it. 

## Instructions

To add a new train, fill out the information and select submit. If the trian submits successfully, you see a pop-up advising that it was added succesfully. Once you select ok, the information is displayed in the table.

For this theme I chose to highlight the 611 train.
